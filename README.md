This is a public repository I created showcasing my skills and knowledge in Playwright. This is a Playwright git repository that includes some E2E Tests that has been developed from scratch for a demo website 'https://practicesoftwaretesting.com/' . This is entirely for practise purpose and whoever wanting to learn can use it too. In addition to that if there's any suggestion and improvement you believe I can make here, feel free to email me here msbajracharya.salona@gmail.com
This repo is still on developing phase as I keep on adding the test cases or improve the existing ones.

**Pre-requisite**
Ensure you have the following installed before setting up Playwright:

- **Node.js** (>= 16.x)
  - Download and install from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** (Comes with Node.js)

**⚙️ Setup Instructions**
-  Clone this Repository in your machine
-  Open the repo from the Visual Studio or any IDE you installed
-  Install Playwright:
   ```sh
    npm install
    npx playwright install
   ```
**Running Tests**
The test are usuaky categorized in such a way that they might or moght not need login session. Currently there's 2 kinds of test in this repo
- e2e-after-logins >  [this is test with logged in user]
- e2e-without-logins >  [this doesn't need login]
- Other test [IN PROGRESS]

1. To run tests that needs login as first step which is under folder e2e-after-logins:
   ```sh
   npx run test:authorized
   ```
2. To run tests that doesn't need login which is under folder e2e-without-logins:
   ```sh
   npx run test:uauthorized
   ```

3. To run all the test in parallel [Remember, the tests are categories as with/without loins]:
   ```sh
   npx run test:all:parallel
   ```
4. To generate an HTML report after test execution:
   No matter what kind of test you run, it is configured in such a way that it will generate the report
   - Open the report using:
     ```sh
     npx playwright show-report
     ```
